# Crypto Scraping

This is a personal project where I get the top 50 cryptocurrencies from [CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com) and save them on a Excel file with all data from the website.

An important disclaimer is: I chose to use a **chrome-for-testing** because:
1. Updates wouldn't break the code;
2. I could insert a portable Chrome to the repo and no one would need to change filepaths.
